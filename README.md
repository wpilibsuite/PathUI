# PathWeaver

PathWeaver is an under-development front end motion planning program. It is primarily designed for FRC teams using [Pathfinder v1](https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder). PathWeaver will be available for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition game with support for [Pathfinder v2](https://github.com/GrappleRobotics/Pathfinder).

The two primary design criteria are
1. Creating and modifying paths should be as natural as possible.
2. Stored files should all be human readable and version controllable.
